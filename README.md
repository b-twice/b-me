# Me

An app, not just about me, but for me. Designed to be responsive and mobile first. 

A mix of static content (published with org-mode) to dynamic content, such as viewing and managing books, the Me App is defined by what I'm interested in. The motivation being the need to organize the content around my life into an application that I can access anywhere, and interact with, if needed.

No better way to understand then to check it [out over here](https://me.brianbrown.dev).
